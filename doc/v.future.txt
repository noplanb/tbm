Bugs
- Invitation
  - Cancel on send link or any other point should not connect you to the friend.
  - Use the has_app api in the invite flow
  - Handle auth errors and other errors in the invite flow.
- Shortcut icon duplicates on motoG.
- Sms takes a long time and bench is not populated. So pulling out the bench before it is ready shows as unpopulated.
- When laying out the grid make sure we have enough vertical space as well as setting the horizontal space.
- Some indication that the file will fail permanently Upload and download.
- Bluetooth
  - Make bluetooth duck work for record as well as playback.
  - Try setting audioManager to voice call.

- First name should have last initial if there are more than one of the same. Work to distinguish them Mike Sample and Mike Smedberg.

- Flashing screen when app should be in background.
- Try adding backgroundFlag to our intents to see if it helps prevent the app from popping into the foreground and whether it keeps the app in the task manager. 
- Our app flashes on the screen when video comes in even if app is in the background.
- Alarm indicator
- Camera stopped working.
- the first part of the audio is cut off. Wait for beep, start recording right away, try "1, 2, 3" right after the beep. On playback it will start with 2 or 3.
- Dimming video record screen on MotoG
- Problem with MotoG and setRecordingHint(true);
 
 
 FUTURE
- When we work with S3 directly we need a concept of permanent failure for download mainly but also upload and a way to indicate it to the client.
