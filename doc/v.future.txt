 Rodja says: From activities lifecycle point of view it's therefore needed to call onPause() before onNewIntent()

 Android didn't NEED to design it this way. Your activity has already gone through its lifecycle to resume(). If the app is resumed the os could simply call onNewIntent() and stay in the resumed state.
 
The problem with Android's sequence is that it makes it impossible to distinguish between onPause due to user action vs onPause due to a background intent. If you want to act onPause only in the case of user action you are screwed because you wont know till the future why you go the onPause().
