 Polling   

Notification unreliability.
   This is not as big a problem but definitely one that has come up in many cases for Kon and some cases with Jill. Often you are connected to wifi but the port for notifications is not allowed by router policy, tcp socket not allowed, or you dont get notification for some other reason. In this case messages are stuck on the server even if you check your app when you think you have good coverage. This is the case for Kon right now with a message stuck on server.
   This can significantly improved with some simple polling on startup. And periodic smart polling when running and you are in a state that is expecting a reply might be even better with a trade off on expense.
