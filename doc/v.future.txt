Bugs
- IntentHandler:  PowerManager pm = (PowerManager) homeActivity.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
		return !pm.isScreenOn(); isScreenOn has been deprecated.


    
- When laying out the grid make sure we have enough vertical space as well as setting the horizontal space.
- Some indication that the file will fail permanently Upload and download.
- Make bluetooth duck work for record as well as playback.
- Try setting audioManager to voice call.
- Launch icon says tbm instead of three by me
- First name should have last initial if there are more than one of the same. Work to distinguish them Mike Sample and Mike Smedberg.

- Flashing screen when app should be in background.
- Kon sees video too short notification. Has to reboot the phone to make it stop happening. Then it comes back sometime later.
- Try adding backgroundFlag to our intents to see if it helps prevent the app from popping into the foreground and whether it keeps the app in the task manager. 
- Our app flashes on the screen when video comes in even if app is in the background.
- Alarm indicator
- Camera stopped working.
- the first part of the audio is cut off. Wait for beep, start recording right away, try "1, 2, 3" right after the beep. On playback it will start with 2 or 3.
- Dimming video record screen on MotoG
- Problem with MotoG and setRecordingHint(true);
 
 
 FUTURE
- When we work with S3 directly we need a concept of permanent failure for download mainly but also upload and a way to indicate it to the client.
