Bugs
 - Kon sees video too short notification. Has to reboot the phone to make it stop happening. Then it comes back sometime later.
 - Try adding backgroundFlag to our intents to see if it helps prevent the app from popping into the foreground and whether it keeps the app in the task manager. 
 - Our app flashes on the screen when video comes in even if app is in the background.
 - Alarm indicator
 - Camera stopped working.
 - the first part of the audio is cut off. Wait for beep, start recording right away, try "1, 2, 3" right after the beep. On playback it will start with 2 or 3.
 - Dimming video record screen on MotoG
 - Problem with MotoG and setRecordingHint(true);
