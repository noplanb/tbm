I added widgetDemo project to my workspace.

POSSIBLE TECHNIQUE: use a widget that you can programmatically add and remove from the lock screen.
 x Download WidgetDemo and import into eclipse.
 x Test that you can add the widget to the home screen. 
 x create an activity in WidgetDemo.
 x Make it add and remove a shortcut from the home page using addIntent.setAction("com.android.launcher.action.INSTALL_SHORTCUT");
 o Make it add and remove the widget from the homescreen. Cant.
 o Add the widget to the keyguard screen. Didnt try.
 
 o I am able to add an icon to the home screen programmatically but not a widget. I am barking up the wrong tree.
 
POSSIBLE TECHNIQUE: use and activity with  getWindow().addFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED);
  TRY
  x Using the test project: TestTaskManager
  x Add a splash activity
  x Make the activity launch after a delay with intent echo service
  x Give the activity the right look and feel.
  x Make the dismiss button work: finish()
  x Make the view button work: Intent to open main
  
Integrate into TBM
  x Look at how we currently do notifications. 
  x Instead of calling finish when we dont want to bring our app to the fore after an intent call moveTaskToBack()
  x If we are not Foreground then always keep in back
  x Test receive video
    x In foreground
    x In background
    x Terminated
  x Create class NotificationAlertManager
    x Add notification code from intent handler.
    x Point intent handler to NotificationAlertManager
    x Add remove notifications on resume
    x Copy activity, layout, drawables etc from testTaskManager
    x Factor the intent for creating the native notification and use for creating lock screen notification.
    x Show lock screen notification under the right conditions (Screen is off)
      x Pass and include attributes for notification in intent.
      x Do not finish home activity when showing lock screen notification just keep in background
      x Put task in background and finish lock screen notification for dismiss
    - Get custom notification tone
  - Test
    - App on VR | VS
    - App Stopped
