QUESTION - How does startActivity due to new intents work into the application lifecycle.
  
  - What happens when new intent comes in when State is:
    - State: Activity shutdown
      - Goes to onCreate()
    - State: Activity running
      - Goes to onPause() -> onNewIntent() -> onResume()
    - State: Activity Stopped but restartable
      - Goes to onNewIntent() -> onRestart() -> onStart() -> onResume()
    - State: Activity Stopped but app processes killed
      - I have never been able to create this but I think it might be responsible for the spurious bug in jills phone. Perhaps we sometimes go to 
        onNewintent() here even though the app processes were killed when it should be going to onCreate() instead.
        
        
=======
PROBLEM - Jills phone has a spurious bug where models retrieved from the file system are empty. This is very hard to reproduce though I once saw it on my phone as well. Probably need to try several things and see if it goes away.

POSSIBLE CAUSES
 - Cause: app enters through newIntent() even though it was in a stopped state where app process were killed.
   - Try: ensuring models are loaded on NewIntent.
 - Cause: We have a thread safety issue where VideoStatusHandler is reading the models from file at the same time our activity is writing them onPause for example.
   - Try: In ActiveModelFactory make save and retrieve synchronized. 

=======
PROBLEM - Sometimes when you come back to the app the thumbnails are blacked out. 

POSSIBLE CAUSE
  - Cause - somehow when stopped the activity looses some view state but it is not sent to onCreate() but rather to onStart() when returning so it is not initialized.
  - Try 
    - moving view initialization into onStart 
    - making model initialization lazy in onStart()

=======
PROBLEM - Don't want app to come to the foreground for SentVideoStatus but want it to come to the foreground for VideoReceived.
