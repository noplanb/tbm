Todo:
  - Look at docs for GCM and determine how to distinguish between messages for ReceivedVideo and UpdateVideoStatus
    - Add a type field and status field
    
 - Refactor
   - VideoStatusHandler
     - Should be the only place where Friend is updated or read for video status information (Viewed / SentVidoeStatus)
     - Multiple process should be able to update video status without conflicting.
     - For writes it should always read from file before updating model the write to file 
     - For reads it should always read from file
     
     
   - Add the methods to set and get status to the videostatushandler
   - Move video viewed changes to got through the videostatushandler
     - GCM intent
     - Play video
   - Move sentvideostatus updates to go through videostatus handler
     - GCM intent
     - Intent handler
