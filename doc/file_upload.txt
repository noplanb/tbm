PROBLEM
 - FileUpload extending IntentService when activity is destroyed it also stops the service.
 

TEST
 - Create test remote long lived service that is not activity service and see if we can make it outlive the activity.


SOLUTION:
  - Created a class I call NonStopIntentService that does not call stopSelf and relies on onhandleintent to do so.
  - Returned START_REDELIVER_INTENT to onStart so that after our activity goes away and service is restarted it gets the last non completed intent.
