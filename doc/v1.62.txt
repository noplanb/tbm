- Bug reported by Kon
 * record message
 * click home immediately after done recording
 * Go to task manager
 EXPECT -> TBM to be normal and can click on it
 ACTUAL -> TBM fucked up and can't click on it; when you do, you go to home screen, not TBM
 FIXED in VideoStatusHandler
 
- Added a Try Again button to the camera in use dialog. If you encounter the error try that button and see if it clears in the next couple attempts.
