Previous v2.6.7 (83)
Current v2.7.25 (110)

BACKGROUND CHANGES:
Changes in Friend model:
1. Added CONNECTION CREATOR flag
2. Added DELETED flag
Added new gestures detection: moving boxes in and out of rectangle center
Added debug options for features:
1. delete welcomed friends from KVstore
2. Lock all features
3. "Enable all features" debug option
4. Show unlocked features
Sync Welcomed friends
Implemented event-based architecture for hints
Dispatch server exception on S3
Added support for forcing SMS sending on staging server during registration
Added debug options groups
Send invitee emails to the server
Added new REMOTE_STATUS to IncomingVideo model which describes states of file on remote:
1. EXISTS - video has never been tried to be deleted (it was not downloaded or failed)
2. DELETE_KV - state, when remote video is requested to be deleted and KV delete request should be sent
3. KV_DELETED - state, when video is deleted from KV store and delete request to S3 should be sent
4. DELETED - state, when video has been deleted from KV store and delete request to S3 has been sent.
Added MARKED_FOR_DELETION status to Incoming video (along with DOWNLOADING, DOWNLOADED etc.) to support state,
when IncomingVideo should be removed from model only when it is deleted from KV store successfully.
SO now IncomingVideo could be removed from model only if it has STATUS = MARKED_FOR_DELETION and REMOTE_STATUS = DELETED.
Request to delete video from remote is sent when video is DOWNLOADED or FAILED_PERMANENTLY or, 
if it wasn't removed yet, when video goes to MARKED_FOR_DELETION state.
IncomingVideo goes to MARKED_FOR_DELETION state when video was FAILED_PERMANENTLY or VIEWED and we just downloaded a new one for the same user (removeAllViewed).
