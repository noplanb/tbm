Completely unable to record on Nexus 6 running 5.0

PROBLEM:
"Camera in use" always for Nexus 6. The reason is setting unsupported frame rate for recorder (15).

Add the person as a friend even if no sms is sent.
PROBLEM:
Currently if the user cancels just at the point of sending the invite sms we do not add the friend. This is a problem because user may wish to still add the friend but let him know about the app another way.

SOLUTION:
After user cancels at the last moment before sending an sms present dialog regarding sms not sent. But still add the friend show the friend added dialog and allow him to send a welcome message as usual.
