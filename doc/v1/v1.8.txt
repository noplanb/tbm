v1.8 - 18 6/20/2014

Visible Changes
===============
 - Video status includes downloading status including retry as well as sent status.
 - Uses private directory for file storage
   - Videos not accessible by the outside world
   - Deleting the app deletes your data so shouldn't have that problem of getting wedged and having to use adb.
   
   
Architecture changes (Virtually complete rewrite)
=================================================
 - Registration sends platform info
 - Change to new server architecture
   - Sender generates random id.
   - Receiver queries by id.
   - Ready for direct to AWS.
 - Eliminate Video Status handler
 - Fold video status into friend model as in ios
 - HomeActivity registers as a delegate to receive videoStatus change events for each friend.
 - Services never touch the models. 
   - They only pass intents to the HomeActivity which processes them through the intent handler.
   - They receive everything they need through intents.
   - Hopefully no more thread safety considerations
 - Rewrite of backgroundFileTransfer
   - Now subclassed to download and upload
   - The share the retry facility of the parent.
   - Downloads get retry for the first time no crash on download fail.
   - Very clean with and well encapsulated

Bug Fixes
=========
 - FIXED: MotoG video recording doesnt work. This took me almost 8 hours to find. It turns out mm_camera driver on that device OEM does not like the standard API setting of setRecordingHint(true). This is a bummer because it causes a visible delay in the recording preview coming on on the other phones.
 
 - HOPEFULLY FIXED: ActiveModel not being available at random times to other processes and threads. This should never happen anymore with the new architecture.
 
TODO
====
 - Make retry holdoff exponential again after some testing.
 - Reset retry holdoff on going to foreground.
