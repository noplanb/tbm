Release Notes for Andrey
========================

New server being set up by Alexander
------------------------------------
  - My changes to invite will not run against your server. 
  - Alexander should be putting a server online for you in the morning. Please have him let you know when it is ready.
  - You will need to point to it in config.java so get the url from him for that.
  
InfoDialogFragment
------------------
  - I tried to use your InfoDialogFragment but found that I could not control the labels and number of buttons. 
  - I used it in only one place Server.showFailureDialog and it is not correct as it requires only a single button labeled "Ok" and preferably settable by the caller.
  - Please fix this error dialog. 
  - I did not attempt to convert the rest of the dialogs in InvitationManager to your new format.

Bugs
----
- Bug (in your code?)
  - The line:  GridManager.moveFriendToGrid(activity, friend);  in InvitationManager.connectedDailog() throws an exception trying to move the friend to grid after invitation is complete.
  12-18 18:16:54.613: W/UnexpectedTerminationHelper(2481): java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.FrameLayout cannot be cast to com.noplanbees.tbm.ui.FriendView
  12-18 18:16:54.613: W/UnexpectedTerminationHelper(2481): 	at com.noplanbees.tbm.ui.FriendsAdapter.getFriendView(FriendsAdapter.java:84)
  - I left this for you.

- Bug (in your code?)
  - Friends with hasApp=true are showing NUDGE/RECORD. They should only show RECORD. To test you can easily change a friend from hasApp to !hasApp on the server admin screen by setting the device_platform field for the user to ios or android.

- Bug (in your code)
  - After first message is received the sender hasApp should be set to true so that the Nudge/record button dissapears and the thumbnail for incoming video is shown. 
  
- Andrey - Please check all the cases for uploading, downloading, hasApp, !hasApp, playing a video while a new one comes in,  etc. Some of these cases are listed in zazo.testrail.com. I must say that IOS is in much better shape as far as handling all the corner cases at this point. 

Incomplete
----------
- I could not see where you added a click handler for nudge button. I added: new InvitationManager(activity).nudge(friend). Please wire it to the nudge button.

- Additional features you need to add:
  - Tapping on record button should bring up the dialog:
                            initWithTitle:@"Hold to Record"
                                  message:@"Press and hold the RECORD button to record."
                        cancelButtonTitle:@"Ok"

- Please note all the graphical assets including the thumbMising Z are now on gitHub at: https://github.com/noplanb/Artwork
