Background of the Problem
-------------------------
The Zazo app has a couple services that run in the background. 
  - File Transfer (Upload and Download)
  - Broadcast receiver for notification intents.
  
The for models that require persistence the app saves it state in the file system. 
  - I want only an activity - the main activity to 
  
  
App Service/Activity project.
-----------------------------
- Create a sample project that has and Activity with a ui as well as a background service.
- Background service should send intents to the Activity.
- If the activity is in the background it should handle the intents without coming to the foreground or flashing the screen.
- If the activity is in the foreground it should handle the intents while continuing to display its ui.

Video record dimming in low light
---------------------------------
- Create a sample project with cameraPreview media recorder to record a 320x240 size video. 
- Figure out why in dim light conditions the preview and recording darkens considerably when you start recording.
