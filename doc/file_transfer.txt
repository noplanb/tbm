PROBLEM
 - FileUpload extending IntentService when activity is destroyed it also stops the service.
  TEST
    - Create test remote long lived service that is not activity service and see if we can make it outlive the activity.
  SOLUTION:
    - Created a class I call NonStopIntentService that does not call stopSelf and relies on onhandleintent to do so.
    - Returned START_REDELIVER_INTENT to onStart so that after our activity goes away and service is restarted it gets the last non completed intent.
